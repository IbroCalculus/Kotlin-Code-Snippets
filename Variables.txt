 
 var sName: String
 sName = "Suleiman"
 lateinit var userName: String


NB: Types in kotlin are non-null by default. ie var sName: String = null; error. Else; 
                                                var sName: String? = null; OR 
                                                var sName: String


Either var or val. val value cannot be re-assigned, where as var can.

    var fName = "Ibrahim";
    var sName = "Suleiman";
    println("You are welcome Mr " +fName + " " + sName);
    println("You are welcome Mr $fName $sName");

    var a = 56;
    var b = 75;
    print("The sum of $a and $b is: ${a+b}")


NB: To declare an empty variable;
NB: Types in Kotlin are non-Null by default. ie
	val z: String = null		-> Error

	val z: String? = "test"		-> Correct
	z = null

	var firstNumber: Int? = null
	firstNumber = 25

E.g
var firstName: String? = null;
var firstNumber: Int? = null;
var firstDouble: Double? = null;
var firstFloat: Float? = null;

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    
    firstName = "Ibrahim";
    firstNumber = 4567
    firstDouble = 487.2345676543
    firstFloat = 12.34f

}




There are 2 types of variables;

1. Mutable variables, which can have their values re-assigned; defined using var keyword
	var fname: String = "Ibrahim"
 OR 	var fname = "Ibrahim"		//THE data type indicator, ie String is not compulsory

2. Local read-only variable, (constant)
    val fname: String = "Ibrahim"

    println("You are welcome " + fname)
    print("You are welcome $fname")


VARIABLES can be declared outside of the main function, these are called top-level variables

VARIABLE TYPES:
	var fname: String = "Ibrahim"
	var fNum: Int = 34;
