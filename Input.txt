INPUTS ARE BY DEFAULT STRINGS. You may convert from String to e.g Int using; ..readline()!!.toInt()

    println("What is your name?:")
    var input = readLine();
    print("You are welcome Mr $input, It is nice to have you amongst us.")

readLine!! -> The input cannot be null

    println("Enter 2 numbers to find their products: ")
    print("Enter first number: ")
    var x = readLine()!!.toInt();
    print("Enter second number: ")
    var y = readLine()!!.toInt();
    var answer = x * y
    print("The product of $x and $y is equal $answer")
    print("The product of $x and $y is equal ${x*y}")
