Innerclasses are classes which are declared inside another class. They are generally used when you know there is a very close relationship between 2 classes.


class ListView(val listViewItems : Array<String>){
    inner class ListViewItem(){
        fun displayItem(position: Int){
            println("Item is: " + listViewItems[position])
        }
    }
}

    val listView = ListView(arrayOf("One", "Two","Three", "Four","Five", "Six"))
    listView1.ListViewItem().displayItem(2)  //OUTP
