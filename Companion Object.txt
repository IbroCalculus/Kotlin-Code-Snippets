Any variable, function etc that is meant to be static should be enclosed within the companion object block in the class. ie


class Calculator(){
    
    // 1. Without companion object (non-static)
    fun sum(a: Int, b:Int): Int {
        return a+b;
    }

    // 2.  With companion object (static)
    companion object {
    fun sum2(a: Int, b:Int): Int {      // A static method
            return a+b;
        }

    var salary:Int = 5000           // A static variable. It is within the companion block as well as the sum2 function
    }
}
